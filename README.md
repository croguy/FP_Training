# FP_Training
A repository of the mission file(s) which we will utilize to attempt to enact training and improvement at FPArma.

**DESIGN OUTLINE**<br/>
• *USE ONLY AND ONLY ARMA3+APEX+ACE3 CONTENT - DLC IS PERMITTED IF NOT ESSENTIAL*
• Every component of the training should be described and depicted within the mission(s). 
• Preferably, Malden's Training Island should be the only location encompassing the training environment. 


**TODO**<br/>
• Implement a teleporter, if possible.
• Finish drawing and writing on-site guides.
• Add more courses to the Anti-Shock training facility
• Reduce the amount of objects and optimize the environment?
• Revamp the firing range to allow different weapon types and ammunition to be used without "compromising" the environment.
• Figure out a way to stock people with ammunition in live fire courses(Marksman training, AT training et al)
• Figure out a way to respawn targets
